Applications can register their profiles with UFW upon installation. 
These profiles allow UFW to manage these applications by name. OpenSSH, 
the service that allows you to connect to your server, has a profile registered with UFW.
You can examine the list of installed UFW profiles by typing: ufw app list
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw status
