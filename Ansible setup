Installing Ansible
To install Ansible on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

Add the Ansible repository to your system's package sources list by running the following command:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
Update your package sources and upgrade your system's packages by running the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Install Ansible by running the following command:

sudo apt install ansible
Setting up the Inventory File
The inventory file is a configuration file that contains a list of hosts and groups that Ansible manages. Follow these steps to set up the inventory file:

Open the inventory file in a text editor. In this example, we'll use nano:

sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
Add the IP address or hostname of the remote server to the inventory file. In this example, we'll add a server with the IP address 192.168.0.101 to a group called servers:

[servers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.0.101
You can add additional servers and groups as needed.

Save the file and exit the text editor.
Testing Ansible
After installing Ansible and setting up the inventory file, you can test Ansible by running the following commands:

List the hosts and groups in the inventory file by running the following command:

ansible-inventory --list -y
Ping all the hosts in the inventory file by running the following command:

ansible all -m ping
If Ansible can successfully connect to the remote server and ping it, you should see a success message.
